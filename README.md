# AlphabetGame
A game to type the alphabet, with a timer. 

This game was created as practice for my JS.
The game has functions like highlighting the next letter that is expected, and accepts any letters, but only gives you progress if you press the correct keys. It also doesn't stop the timer unless the entire alphabet is written. 


Currently working on more features like statistics, previous times etc.
